# en_to_tr_translation
The Jupyter Notebook demonstrates utilizing Hugging Face and Gradio to perform English-to-Turkish translation. 
Hugging Face is a popular library for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, while Gradio simplifies building and sharing custom interfaces for machine learning models. 
The script defines a translation function using Hugging Face's transformers library and integrates it into a user-friendly web interface using Gradio.

The default model used for translation does not contain English to Turkish-translation. For the purpose of the project "Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-tc-big-en-tr" model is used instead of default model.

The code uses Gradio to create a web-based user interface for English-to-Turkish translation.
